  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### Test Webhook Integration

#### Using Stripe CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Install Stripe CLI
# https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli

# Login to Stripe
stripe login

# Forward webhooks to local server
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:5001/api/payments/webhook

# In another terminal, trigger test events
stripe trigger checkout.session.completed
stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded
stripe trigger payment_intent.payment_failed
```

## üé® Frontend Component Testing

### Test Purchase Confirmation Modal States

The modal supports multiple states for comprehensive testing:

#### Success State
```javascript
// In browser console on course detail page
// Trigger success modal
showDemoModal('succeeded');
```

#### Pending State
```javascript
// Trigger pending modal
showDemoModal('pending');
```

#### Failed State
```javascript
// Trigger failed modal
showDemoModal('failed');
```

### Test Purchase History Component

1. Navigate to Profile ‚Üí Purchase History
2. Test filtering by status
3. Test pagination (if multiple purchases exist)
4. Verify responsive design on mobile

## üêõ Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Server not starting on port 5000
**Solution**: The server automatically uses port 5001 if 5000 is occupied (common on macOS due to AirPlay)

### Issue: Stripe integration not working
**Solution**: 
1. Check environment variables in `.env` file
2. Ensure Stripe keys are set correctly
3. Use test keys (sk_test_...) for development

### Issue: Webhook not receiving events
**Solution**:
1. Use Stripe CLI for local testing
2. Check webhook endpoint URL in Stripe dashboard
3. Verify webhook secret is configured

### Issue: Enrollment not created after payment
**Solution**:
1. Check webhook logs in server console
2. Verify database connection
3. Check enrollment creation logic in webhook handler
